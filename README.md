# For Companies - Opening OSS contract!

I have an open spot for an OSS contract to work with me! Consider working with me if:

- you/your employees use/like uithub / openapi-mcp
- you want to improve context for your AI workflows and MCPs
- you have a use case that requires custom features or my expertise consulting
- you want me to share the experience of your product publicly (i have to use/like it first)

# For developers - Deposit Any Amount To Use These Tools!

The sponsored amount gets credited to your account and is linked with your GitHub Account. It can be used for all APIs, tooling, and agents connected to this ecosystem. The ecosystem will get larger as I keep building.
