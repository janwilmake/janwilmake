Hi I'm Jan. Working on OSS high-scale AI Code Transformation.

I aim to create an AGI-like system by creating software that can reliably build software.

## Contributing

Join me on this journey by checking out my [OSS work](https://github.com/janwilmake?tab=repositories) and [leave a message](https://github.com/janwilmake/janwilmake/discussions). Also happy to [chat on X](https://x.com/janwilmake) - not always responsive though.

## Licensing

Unless otherwise stated, all my open-source work is dual-licensed:

### 1. AGPL v3 License

Free for organizations that meet BOTH criteria:

- Fewer than 50 employees
- Annual revenue under €10M

### 2. Commercial License

Required if your organization meets ANY of these criteria:

- 50 or more employees
- Annual revenue of €10M or more

For commercial licensing, please [directly sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/janwilmake) or reach out for individual arrangements.

The AGPL v3 license ensures code changes are shared back with the community. This protects the open source nature of the project while ensuring commercial users contribute fairly to its development.
