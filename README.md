# The Agent-Friendly Web

I'm On a Mission To Make The Open Internet Agent-Friendly through URLs (Universal Resource Locators). All below websites
are mirrors (some better, some worse) that allow accessing the information from the website in a token-dense format
(usually Markdown).

- Google - https://googllm.com
- GitHub - https://uithub.com
- NPMJS - https://npmjz.com
- Cloudflare Dashboard - https://flaredream.com
- APIs - https://openapisearch.com
- X - https://xymake.com
- LLM - https://lmpify.com
- ArXiv (Papers) - https://arxivmd.org
- YouTube - https://youtudo.com (Unstable)
- Aggregated - https://llmtext.com (Unstable)

Now that we have the URL back to what is was meant for, now for LLMs, we can use it directly in our interfaces for
context building. I've build https://contextarea.com to demonstrate this, and it's first application where it can be
used is https://lmpify.com

I believe that building with these principles will create a more open, more connected, and ultimately, better internet.
One with a shared interface that is browsable by humans as well as agents.

I'm using Cloudflare to deploy everything. They have everything I need.

Useful Build Patterns:

- How Agents Store Information - https://getdorm.com
- How Agents Identify - https://simplerauth.com
- How Agents Pay - https://github.com/janwilmake/stripeflare
- Agent-Friendly Web Principles - https://github.com/janwilmake/user-agent-router
- Bringing it together - https://github.com/janwilmake/user-agent-402

There's much more in my GitHub at https://github.com/janwilmake although it's a bit less organised. You can also check
out https://lists.forgithub.com/janwilmake for lists I keep track of.

If you like my mission, you can support me by sharing it, using the products, and helping me with feedback and finding
ways to improve this ecosystem and movement.

# Backstory

I'm Jan and for the last 3 years I'm all in building an army of agents to scale productivity.

I quit my job april '22 to start full-time independent research on applied AI. Among other things, I've been Working on OSS high-scale AI Code Analysis and Transformation, I aim to create an AGI-like system by creating software that can reliably build software.

# For Companies - Opening OSS contract!

I have an open spot for an OSS contract to work with me! Consider working with me if:

- you/your employees use/like uithub / openapi-mcp
- you want to improve context for your AI workflows and MCPs
- you have a use case that requires custom features or my expertise consulting
- you want me to share the experience of your product publicly (i have to use/like it first)
