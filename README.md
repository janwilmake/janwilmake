# The Agent-Friendly Web

Hi, I'm Jan and for the last 3 years I'm all in building an army of agents to scale productivity.

I quit my job april '22 to start full-time independent research on applied AI. Among other things, I've been Working on OSS high-scale AI Code Analysis and Transformation, I aim to create an AGI-like system by creating software that can reliably build software.

It's my Mission to Ensure the Agent-Friendly Internet will be Open and Distributed. I work on and with MCP, OpenAPI, OAuth, Cloudflare, and many gen-ai API products. I love good standards. Learn more with these [top posts on X](https://x.com/search?q=from:janwilmake%20min_faves:20&src=typed_query&f=top). Check out https://lists.forgithub.com/janwilmake for lists I keep track of.

The main products that I built that I use daily are [uithub](https://uithub.com) and [contextarea](https://contextarea.com). You will see this list expand over the coming years. The main products I did not build that I use daily are Cloudflare, X, VSCode, and GitHub. You will see this list shrink over the coming years.
