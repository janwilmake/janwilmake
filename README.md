# I'm Jan and I've coded 1000s of hours hacking together 100s of tools for agents to work at my next business ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ¤–

I quit my job april '22 to start full-time independent research on applied AI. Among other things, I've been Working on OSS high-scale AI Code Analysis and Transformation, I aim to create an AGI-like system by creating software that can reliably build software. Crazy, huh?

[I'm looking for up to 50 'sponsors' sponsoring $50 per month](https://github.com/sponsors/janwilmake) that wish to be included in my experimental testing group. It's best if you're an experienced programmer or at least want to learn (with the help of LLMs). I have dozens of tools directly available for this group, free of further charge, and dozens more coming up.
